# JQuery part two: It's not just client side anymore

## Learning Competencies

* Sending information to a server with AJAX.
* Handling a server response.

## Summary

AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript And XML

It's really Asynchronous Javascript And XML or JSON or HTML or Text or JS

It is a way to pass information between the browser and server without requiring a full page refresh.

Imagine a home remodeling project and you want to replace the kitchen cabinets

Do you knock down the whole house?

A Full Page Refreshes Demolishes Your Whole Page but all you want is a fantastic new kitchen

AJAX Lets You Update Exactly What You Want, nothing more nothing less.

And like we mentioned before, it gives you lots of options for data transmission:

- XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
- Text
- JavaScript Code

In this challenge we are going to be working with JSON and HTML


## Releases

### Release 0: Setup 
(make sure jQuery is loaded, have the document ready function, skeleton html)


### Release 1: Stop the browser from doing a full page refresh


### Release 2: Send AJAX request and confirm a response 
confirm with (console.log)


### Release 3: Sending different dataTypes
Send AJAX request with different data types and confirm receiving a response (console.log)
### Release 4: Use the response and DOM Traversal to update the page

### Release 5: Use failure and always when handling response

### Bonus!

- switch the data type requested and make the page work with that
- handle the user clicking something more than once, only making the ajax call when necessary
